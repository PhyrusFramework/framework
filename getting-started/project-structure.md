# Project Structure

Phyrus puts everything you don't need to see in the **framework composer package** (located in /**vendor/phyrus/framework**). In the root folder you will have only what you need, which is:

* index.php
* The **src** folder
* configuration file (config.json)
* .htaccess
* composer.json (Dependencies)

The **src** folder is your workspace, here you will freely work and create your files without any interference from the framework.

Inside the src folder there are the following directories:

| Folder       | Description                     |
| ------------ | ------------------------------- |
| /assets      | CSS, SCSS, JS, Images, Fonts... |
| /code        | PHP Code                        |
| /pages       | Controllers for auto-routing    |
| /components  | Reusable components             |
| /middlewares | Middleware controllers          |

Along the docs it is explained how to use each one of these folders and the files inside.
